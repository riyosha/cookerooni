## Recipe Retrieval and Generation 

### 1. FAISS + retrieval + custom prompting with Gemini/Clause/OpenAI
- Embedding: manually embed with sentence-transformers

### 2. LangChain + ChromaDB/Pinecone + Gemini/Clause/OpenAi

| Feature                       | FAISS-only | LangChain + ChromaDB |
|-------------------------------|------------|------------------|
| **Author / Maintainer**       | Meta | LangChain |
| **Summary**                    | Local deployment using FAISS vectors and metadata; retrieval done manually | Wrapper around FAISS that integrates retrieval with prompts, chains, and LLMs |
| **Embedding**                  | Done manually, e.g., `SentenceTransformer` | Wrapped via HuggingFaceEmbeddings or OpenAIEmbeddings |
| **Inference Time**             | Retrieval is fast, but building pipelines for prompt + context is manual and can slow things down | Nearly instant for retrieval + feeding context to LLM |
| **Output Quality**             | Depends on your LLM prompt engineering; context must be manually managed | High, because LangChain handles retrieval + prompt combination; easier to ensure relevant context is passed |
| **Error Handling**             | Manual; you handle edge cases in indexing, embedding, or search | Some automatic handling of retrieval failures; still need try/except for API calls |
| **Control**                    | Full control over index structure, embeddings, and persistence | Less low-level control; abstracted but easier to integrate with RAG chains |
| **Scalability**                | Requires you to handle storage, memory, and scaling; complex for very large datasets | LangChain abstracts storage and retrieval; easier to scale and integrate with multiple LLM backends |
| **Ease of Integration with LLMs** | Manual; you have to feed retrieved context to LLM yourself | Built-in; `RetrievalQA` and RAG patterns are ready to use |
| **Persistence**                | You manually save/load FAISS + metadata | `vectorstore.save_local()` and `load_local()` handle both index and metadata together |
| **Use Cases**                  | Custom pipelines, full local control, specialized embeddings | Rapid prototyping RAG systems, multi-step reasoning, user-facing apps with LLMs |
